### Technical specialities of the Swissbit Cloud
The Swissbit Cloud TSE has a few technical specialities compared to other fiskaltrust.middleware configurations, which should definitely be taken into account during the rollout.
1.the Swissbit cloudbased TSE  is permanently paired to the computer on which it is running.
2. limitations of the product when individually purchased (outside of a fiskaltrust.CarefreeBundle)
3. additional firewall requirements for the necessary internet connection.

##### 1.the Swissbit cloudbased TSE  is permanently connected (paired) to the computer on which it is running.
During initialisation,the Swissbit cloudbased TSE  is permanently paired to the computer on which it is running. After the first communication with the Swissbit Cloud Servers, it can only be run on exactly this computer. With the fiskaltrust.middleware, this happens when the CashBox configured withthe Swissbit cloudbased TSE  is executed for the first time. 
Therefore, in this case, the fiskaltrust.Middleware cannot be run on other devices as a test. The installation is a one-time thing. If something is done incorrectly,the Swissbit cloudbased TSE  must be purchased again.

##### 2. Limitations of the product when individually purchased (outside of a fiskaltrust.CarefreeBundle)

When purchasing a Swissbit Cloud TSE as individual product from fiskaltrust there's a limit of one queue per TSE. This limit does not apply when the TSE is part of a fiskaltrust.CarefreeBundle. For details, please refer to the product description LINK.

##### 3. Additional firewall requirements for the necessary internet connection
Please see our [FAQs on firewall settings](https://docs.fiskaltrust.cloud/doc/productdescription-de-doc/for-posdealers/04-after-sales/troubleshooting-firewall.html).
