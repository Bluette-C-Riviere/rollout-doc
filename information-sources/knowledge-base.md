## Introduction

A knowledge base is typically a collection of articles that contains images and text. In the Help Section of the fiskaltrust.Portal PosDealers or PosOperators find knowledge base articles. Our customer success team's frequent questions are the base for these articles.

As a PosDealer or as a PosOperator, you can browse these articles to learn more about fiskaltrust's products or services or how to solve related problems.  

You can avoid possible waiting times with a support request if you **first visit the knowledge base** in the fiskaltrust.Portal.  
If we worked on your issue previously, we have explained a solution.

At the end of each article, you will find the option to leave feedback. In addition to your rating with one up to five stars, leave comments and suggestions. These will help fiskaltrusts Customer Success Team see if the articles meet the needs of PosDealers and help solve problems of PosOperators.
