## Introduction

External service providers can, for example, provide technological support for payment processes or prepare and forward data for accounting.  
You, as a PosDealer, can initialize the exchange with external service providers in the fiskaltrust.Portal and also manage them there.  

**No data exchange can take place without active setup by PosDealer or PosOperator.**  

For details on market-specific third-party products, please refer to the respective instructions or product descriptions [Products](../buy-resell/products/3rd-party/3rd-party-overview.md).  
For manual exchange of data, see the section on [Exports](../technical-operations/maintenance/exports.md).
