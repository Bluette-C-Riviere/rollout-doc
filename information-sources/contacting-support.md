# Contacting support

:::info summary

After reading this, you can decide when and how to get support.

:::

## Explanation

Unfortunately, problems cannot always be avoided in the context of complex processes. Please use this documentation or other sources of information explained below for any tasks. 
This will help you avoid waiting times in case you need to contact support. The fiskaltrust.staff will be happy to handle your requests if you are a PosDealer. 
You will shorten the processing of your request if you first describe the problem and mention the AccountId`s ( `[Company]`/ `Overview`), the used roles and the part of the information sources you used in vain to solve your request by yourself.

### Work steps

All our learning in discussions, requests or how-tos`s result in knowledge base articles, FAQ (see Country-specific information) or releases.
