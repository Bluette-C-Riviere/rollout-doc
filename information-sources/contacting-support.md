:::info summary

After reading this, you can decide when and how to get support.

:::

## Explanation

Unfortunately, problems in the context of complex processes cannot always be avoided. Please use this documentation or other sources of information explained below for any tasks.  
This will help you avoid waiting times in case you need to contact support. The fiskaltrust.Staff will be happy to handle your requests if you are a PosDealer.  
Since we do not know the respective constellations of POS-Systems on site and can therefore provide advice, we must always refer PosOperators to their PosDealer.   

Note the country specific E-mail address below to contact fiskaltrust.Staff.  

To track your requests, please refer to the [Cases](cases.md) section.


## Work steps

All our learning in discussions, requests or how-tos`s result in knowledge base articles, FAQ (see Country-specific information) or releases.
