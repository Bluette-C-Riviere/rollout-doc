# Downloads

:::info summary

After reading this, you can download general information, your contracts and archives.

:::

## Explanation
In the fiskaltrust.Portal, you may take use of three sources for downloads. 

In the overview of your company data **all contracts** are provided, which were sent to you also by mail attachment at the conclusion or a change. These contracts are on the one hand the cooperation agreements depending on the role. On the other hand, you will also find user agreements with third parties, if such have been concluded - please note the different country-specific options. 

Two other download options are summarized in the tools section.
On the one hand, there is information such as procedural documentation, SLA, price lists in the **Downloads section**. These are available for selection depending on the target group. Furthermore, depending on the country, you will find general information such as certificates, brochures, scripts, etc.

On the other hand, in the section **Exports** you will find Export data already prepared earlier (Tools / Exports).
Note that if you are redirected to this section when creating an export (Configuration / Queue), you will be filtered to the Only data packages currently being prepared section.
