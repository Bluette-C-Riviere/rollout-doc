# Buying and Reselling

:::info summary

After reading this, you will know what to do, to buy and resell fiskaltrust products.

:::

## Introduction

In addition to the license-free fiskaltrust.Middleware for PosCreators, fiskaltrust offers fee-based add-on products (which are based on the fiskaltrust.Middleware) and individual products (independent of the fiskaltrust.Middleware) for PosOperators.

For a current listing of our products, please refer to our [product description](./products/overview.md).

POSDealers do not buy the fiskaltrust products themselves in the fiskaltrust.Portal, but so-called **Entitlements**, claims to the products, which they can then transfer to the PosOperators individually and activate them per outlet. 

To buy and resell fiskaltrust products, you have to:
* Register in the fiskaltrust.Portal.
* Sign the cooperation agreement as PosDealer.
* Determine your need for products and product bundles.
* If you plan to buy and resell more than 10 carefree bundles, it is recommended to contact fiskaltrust sales to get a volume purchase agreement. 
* If your planned amount exceeds the standard credit limit, contact fiskaltrust sales.


## Credit limit

When the PosDealer role is activated, a credit limit is also granted in the fiskaltrust.Portal. Note that the limit in the productive system is significantly lower than in the sandbox.

If the invoice amounts exceed the credit limit during rollout management or purchases in the store, you will be notified of the credit limit by a corresponding message when creating further offers. 
If it is not possible to settle the open invoices in a timely manner, contact the sales department responsible for the country in question with a request to grant you more credit limit. Check the tabs below for country-specific details.

## Volume purchase agreement

As mentioned in the section [Business model](../overview/business-model.md), _fiskaltrust_ is offering discounted prices if you agree to a certain purchase quantity. If you are planning to purchase ten or more product bundles, you should consider this option. Our products and product bundles are described [here](products.md).  
If you are committing to purchase **large quantities of product bundles** of your choice over the course of a year, a **Volume Purchase Agreement** is the best option. This allows you to achieve significant discounts depending on your planned sales volume.

### How to get a volume purchase agreement

* Contact fiskaltrust sales via email and state company name, contact, product name/number and the amount you need.
* Our sales team will contact you and send you the volume purchase agreement including the discount calculated.
* Sign the volume purchase agreement and send it back to the sales team.
* After succesful confirmation, we will send the signed agreement back to you.
* The ordered products will be placed in the fiskaltrust.Shop with the agreed prices and are ready to buy for your account.

### Legal Framework

* The contract period is open and the evaluation period for the ordered number of entitlements will be set to one year or the period of your choice.
* The agreed purchase price applies to each allocation of an entitlement, regardless of whether you use the rollout management or prefer the shop.
* By assigning entitlements in the fiskaltrust.Portal according to your needs, you control purchase and accounting by yourself.
