# Overview

:::info summary

After reading this, you will know how the integration of DATEV MeinFiskal works and how to set it up.

:::

:::caution Austria / France

As DATEV MeinFiskal is only available in Germany, this tutorial does not apply to Austria or France.

:::

 "DATEV MeinFiskal" is an integral part of the "fiskaltrust.Sorglos" product bundle.The data is transferred from the fiskaltrust.portal via an automated interface to the "[DATEV MeinFiskal](https://www.meinfiskal.de/)" platform, so the included services "DATEV Kassenarchiv online" and the "DATEV Kassenbuch-Schnittstelle" can be used.

### Process description

The PosDealer activates the DATEV MeinFiskal function in the fiskaltrust.Portal by signing the user agreement on behalf of the PosOperator.
Customer data such as E-Mail address and tax number (St.-ldNr. or USt-ldNr.) are exchanged between the fiskaltrust.Portal and the "[DATEV MeinFiskal](https://www.meinfiskal.de/)" platform. A MeinFiskal user account and a password is created automatically at DATEV, and the same e-mail address is used as in the fiskaltrust.Portal. 
The PosDealer changes the password for the user account at DATEV MeinFiskal and confirms the data transfer between fiskaltrust and DATEV. The PosOperator receives a welcome e-mail from DATEV MeinFiskal and can use the services "DATEV Kassenarchiv online" and the "DATEV Kassenbuch-Schnittstelle".

Fiskaltrust takes over the generation of the legally required data formats (DSFinV-K, DFKA taxonomy, .tar files, native format, other documents), as well as the connection and data transfer to DATEV MeinFiskal via the fiskaltrust.portal. No further connection by the PosCreator is necessary.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

The PosOperator already has an account in the fiskaltrust.portal, agreed to the general terms and conditions and the PosOperator user agreement of fiskaltrust, checked his master data, and the PosDealer has the authorization to sign the contract. If these requirements are not met, the [PosOperator Onboarding](https://docs.fiskaltrust.cloud/docs/posdealers/rollout-doc/invitation-management) must be completed first, or the setup must be performed by the PosOperator itself.

## Troubleshooting

- The PosDealer cannot sign the DATEV MeinFiskal user agreement for the PosOperator, as he is not authorized to do so. The PosDealer must contact the PosOperator to obtain the necessary authorization.

- The PosDealer does not change the password in step 3 and can no longer log on to DATEV MeinFiskal as a PosDealer. After 4 days at the latest, the welcome e-mail is sent to the PosOperator. To continue the process with step 4, the PosDealer must contact the PosOperator to obtain the current password.

- The PosDealer can no longer log on to DATEV MeinFiskal because he no longer has the login data. Therefore, he cannot request another e-mail for a password change on the DATEV MeinFiskal website on his own. This is only possible via the PosOperator once he has received the welcome e-mail with the link to change the password on the DATEV MeinFiskal website.

- The PosDealer cannot complete the linking process between fiskaltrust and DATEV MeinFiskal because the wrong user name (not the same e-mail address as for the fiskaltrust. portal) was entered at DATEV MeinFiskal in step 6. Therefore, the PosDealer must contact the fiskaltrust support so that the incorrect link can be deleted.
