# Digital Receipt

:::info summary

After reading this, you can explain what preparations are necessary for your PosOperators to use digital receipts.

:::

## Introduction

If you include digital receipts in the sales process, the customer can choose between a digital receipt and a printout.  
With digital receipts, the PosOperator can reduce expenses for printouts and help the environment.  
As a PosDealer, you thus offer a state-of-the-art PosSystem.

Please note that the visualization in the sandbox may look different than in the productive system.
Please also note that different regulations or requirements may apply depending on the country in which your POS system is used. Please refer to the country-specific regulations. Please understand that we can only describe these details without claiming to be complete.

## Preparations general

The preparations for having digital receipts available can be made both by PosDealers or PosOperators. For this, only access to the fiskaltrust.Portal with **Write authorizations** is required.
The Master Data of the PosOperators account in the fiskaltrust.Portal must be complete. The stored tax identification numbers should be verified.
The details of the Outlet, not the company, are used as the address on the digital receipt. Therefore, these should be checked for completeness and corrected if necessary. 
The digital receipt may list a logo at the top. If this logo is desired, you should add it to the data of the Outlet. 
We recommend to use for best results a file in ~.png-format with transparent background.
