This tutorial is unfortunately **not yet applicable to the Austrian market** as rollout plans are not active there yet. While we're working on enabling rollout plans in Austria, please use the [shop](./shop.md) to create a SignatureCloud cashbox.

## Introduction

For the scaled rollout of _fiskaltrust_ products, you as PosDealer use the rollout management as described under [`Getting-Started` / `My First CashBox`](../getting-started/my-first-cashbox.md). The Rollout Management consists of two sections:

### Business Rollout

The [business rollout](../getting-started/my-first-cashbox.md#business-rollout-getting-the-scu) simplifies the process for acquiring entitlements, transferring them to the PosOperators outlets and activating (generating) them for the PosOperator. You do not have to switch to the PosOperator's account to transfer and activate the products. The system will automatically select the required products for the chosen Business Rollout plan. This reduces the risk of an incorrect composition of the shopping basket.

### Technical Rollout

The [technical rollout](../getting-started/my-first-cashbox.md#technical-rollout-creating-the-cashbox) can be used, to create the technical components for complete CashBoxes for the selected PosOperator and outlet. 

### Benefits of using a rollout plan

#### Saving time

The use of rollout plans allows you as a PosDealer or your team members to create rapidly the key elements.  
You generate more time for making adjustments, to meet the specific requirements of each PosOperator and their different demands.

#### Improving communication

With the use of rollout plans you can clearly define, what action steps designated team members need to take during different phases of the rollout.
You gain more flexibility to achieve your goals, both in terms of revenue and customer satisfaction.

#### Decreasing stress 

Rollout plans make it easier to identify what the key elements of each phase in the rollout are.
In the case of bug fixes, it is thus quickly clear which status has already been achieved.

#### Increasing buy-in

Focusing on rollout plans give you a helping hand on explaining which products you offer and why. 
This can boost the sales process with your PosOperators.

#### Improving organization 

The use of rollout plans will support you as a PosDealer with a well-organized rollout strategy.
