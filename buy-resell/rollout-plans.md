## Explanation

For the scaled rollout of _fiskaltrust_ products, you as PosDealer use the rollout management as already described under [Rollout Plans](../getting-started/my-first-cashbox.md). In rollout management, the most common products are offered on a market-specific basis.  
A rollout plan guides you through selecting the product, destination and outlets for which you want to rollout. This way you avoid ambiguities about which activities should be performed at which point in time.

You choose a business plan at the beginning, work on the defined sequence of action steps and use it to create the backend components for a CashBox, for example. Depending on the market, a technical rollout can also be used to create, for example queue and CashBox and link the SCU previously created in the business rollout.

### Benefits of using a rollout plan

#### Saving time

The use of rollout plans allows you as a PosDealer or your team members to create rapidly the key elements.  
You generate more time for making adjustments, to meet the specific requirements of each PosOperator and their different demands.

#### Improving communication

With the use of rollout plans you can clearly define, what action steps designated team members need to take during different phases of the rollout.
You gain more flexibility to achieve your goals, both in terms of revenue and customer satisfaction.

#### Decreasing stress 

Rollout plans make it easier to identify what the key elements of each phase in the rollout are.
In the case of bug fixes, it is thus quickly clear which status has already been achieved.

#### Increasing buy-in

Focusing on rollout plans give you a helping hand on explaining which products you offer and why. 
This can boost the sales process with your PosOperators.

#### Improving organization 

The use of rollout plans will support you as a PosDealer with a well-organized rollout strategy.
This facilitates planning for the current year and for the next year, see also the explanation in the section [volume purchase agreement](../buy-resell/volume-purchase-agreement.md).
