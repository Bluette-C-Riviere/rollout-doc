:::info summary

:::

## Explanation

As mentioned in the section [Business Model](../overview/business-model.md), fiskaltrust also offers more favorable dealer packages for you as PosDealer in addition to the bid in the shop of the fiskaltrust.portal. If you are planning to purchase ten or more product bundles, you should consider this option. Our products and product bundles are described [here](products.md).  
If you commit to purchasing larger quantities of product bundles of your choice over the course of a year, attractive discounts can be arranged.  
With this **Framework Agreement** you can achieve significant discounts depending on the planned sales volume.
Please also note the following paragraphs if you are not interested in a framework agreement for the time being. A framework agreement can also be concluded later. 
A **credit limit** for your account in the fiskaltrust.portal must be agreed in any case and also checked before the first transactions.

### Legal Framework

* The contract period is open and the evaluation period for the ordered number of entitlements will be set to one year or the period of your choice.
* The agreed purchase price applies to each allocation of each entitlements, regardless of whether you use the rollout management or prefer the store.
* By assigning entitlements in the fiskaltrust.Portal according to your needs, you control purchase and accounting by yourself.
* You avoid processing refunds because unused Entitlements already purchased can also be used in the following year.
