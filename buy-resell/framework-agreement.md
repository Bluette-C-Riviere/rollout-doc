## Explanation

As mentioned in the section [Business Model] (../Overview/Business%20model), fiskaltrust also offers more favorable dealer packages for you as PosDealer in addition to the offer in the fiskaltrust.portal. If you are planning to purchase ten or more product bundles, you should consider this option. Our products and product bundles are described [here](products).  
If you commit to purchasing larger quantities of product bundles of your choice over the course of a year, attractive discounts can be arranged.  
With this **Framework Agreement** you can achieve significant discounts depending on the planned sales volume.
