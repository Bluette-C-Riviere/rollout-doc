As **PosCreator**, we are happy to support you in the development of Pos-Systems, even for special purposes or particular challenges. With the integration of our free fiskaltrust.Middleware, your Pos-System will immediately become compliant with the law. You save the cost of licenses and maintenance of the part of the software we provide. Since no effort is required for you to monitor the legal situation, you save time, resources and money. This allows you to focus on your core business, the Pos-System. By registering with the fiskaltrust.Portal and activating the role as PosCreator, you can offer your Pos-Systems on our platform. After inviting your PosDealers to the fiskaltrust.Portal, they can start selling your Pos-System.

For **PosDealers**, we offer the fiskaltrust.Portal, which can be used free of charge, as a platform on which the Pos-Systems of the PosCreators can be accessed. You as a PosDealer can purchase additional products and product packages in the store of the fiskaltrust.Portal. 
If your PosOperators are invited to use the fiskaltrust.Portal, the fiskaltrust.products can be transferred to these accounts. For you as a PosDealer, more favorable dealer packages are available in the fiskaltrust.portal for the purchase of ten products. If you commit yourself to purchasing larger quantities of products over the course of a year, attractive discounts can be agreed upon
If the PosOperators use Pos-Systems in combination with our products, the fiskaltrust.Portal also serves you for monitoring or remote maintenance of the Pos-Systems. This enables PosDealers to expand their offerings for PosOperators to include legal and data security, extended import and export functions, and proactive support.

**PosOperators** need functional and legally compliant PosSystems. After the invitation to the fiskaltrust.Portal by the PosDealer and the activation of the role as PosOperator, fiskaltrust.products and product packages can be used. These save data from the Pos-Systems and prepare it for specific countries. The prepared data are immediately available for audits by the fiscal authorities. Interfaces for accounting further help PosOperators to concentrate on their business tasks.
