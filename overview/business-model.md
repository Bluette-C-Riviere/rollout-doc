fiskaltrust offers PosCreators free support in the development of POS-Systems for specific and complex business cases. We also support our partners in exchanging information with each other. On the other hand, we offer the fiskaltrust.middleware free of charge, which enables compliance with legal requirements.
Furthermore, we offer PosCreators and PosDealers the fiskaltrust.portal as a platform. This allows the PosOperator to access cash register systems and resell them to PosOperators. With the fiskaltrust.Portal services of the PosOperator like remote maintenance or system updates of the POS systems can be covered like the stack of tasks around the cash management of a PosDealer.
We also support PosDealers with fee-based extensions to the fiskaltrust.portal. These include offers such as data backup, export functions, support for accounting or cash audit. PosOperators acquire rights to these services from fiskaltrust and sell them on to PosDealers.
