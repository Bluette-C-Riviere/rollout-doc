After reading this, you can explain how fiskaltrust's partner based business model works, and which advantages it has for PosCreators, PosDealers and PosOperators.

:::

## Introduction
fiskaltrust is a software company that focuses on the development of compliance-as-a-service- and add-on products for cash registers within Europe. Our core product, the fiskaltrust.Middleware, can be directly integrated by cash register manufacturers (_PosCreators_) to make their POS software compliant to local fiscalization laws.

The distribution of fiskaltrust's _products_ and _product bundles_ is done in partnership with cash register dealers (_PosDealers_). Using existing sales structures in the respective countries, PosDealers can offer a product portfolio that takes into account and fulfills the individual needs of each of their customers (cash register operators or _PosOperators_).

In this model, the PosOperator remains the direct customer of the PosDealer. Attractive volume discounts on fiskaltrust's products enable PosDealers to integrate these products into their own portfolio and pricing model on their own terms.

Support for the PosOperators is provided by the PosDealer, which in turn is supported by fiskaltrust.

## Advantages for PosDealers

### Products
#### Legally compliant fiscalization from a single source
fiskaltrust acts as an all-in-one fiscalization solution partner. This means that PosDealers have a single point of contact for fiscalization as well as for obtaining solutions for these complex problems.

#### "As-a-Service"
As a customer of our fiscalization solutions, "as-a-service" means that PosDealers and PosOperators no longer have to worry about the topic of legally compliant fiscalization. fiskaltrust always ensures up-to-date, legally compliant fiscalization in the background - even when legal requirements change. Our goal is to enable our partners to focus on their core business, and deliver the best experience to their customers.

#### Product bundles
Our market-specific product bundles include all necessary products and solutions for legally compliant fiscalization. In addition, as described above, they are consistently designed as a service model. Finally, we offer standalone products wherever possible to enable flexible solutions where needed.

#### Flexibility
One of the biggest advantages of fiskaltrust products is their flexibility. Our solutions can be configured flexibly and adapted to existing infrastructure and POS systems. Thus, Middleware packages and configurations can be configured as desired - starting from setups for standalone POS systems, up to highly interconnected cloud systems.

### Distribution model
#### Development of new customer segments
With fiskaltrust's products covering legally compliant fiscalization as a service model, PosDealers can expand their own product portfolio in their core business and address and win new customer segments.

#### Integration into existing product portfolios
The fiskaltrust products are designed to be resold by our partners, and to allow the configuration & installation without the involvement of the PosOperator. This enables PosDealers to fully bundle and include fiskaltrust's products in their own offering.

#### Yearly recurrent revenue
fiskaltrust's products use a subscription model. This means that PosOperators can rest assured that there POS systems are fiscally compliant for a fixed yearly price without having to build assets in case of changed legal requirements. In addition, this model also creates annually calculable, recurring revenues for the PosDealer.

#### Attractive volume discounts
fiskaltrust offers volume discounts starting from low purchase quantities when signing volume purchase agreements, enabling PosDealers to provide optimum customer support and advice in order to achieve the highest possible level of customer satisfaction.

### Portal
#### Buying products at a single place
The fiskaltrust.Portal as a central tool for PosDealers enables the purchase of digital as well as physical products (like hardware signing devices from different manufacturers) in one place.

#### Automation
For large rollouts, fiskaltrust offers a variety of automation options - from the creation of templates for cash register configurations, bulk imports of customers as well as outlets, bulk purchases or assignments of products, to the automated rollout of the fiskaltrust.Middleware.

#### Rollout support
Economic and technical preparations for a rollout to end-users can take place independently of each other: Thus, the purchase and resale of fiskaltrust's products can be handled independently of technical rollout scenarios, configuration and commissioning on site.

#### After-sales support
Even after a rollout is completed, functionalities such as mass updates of configurations or middleware updates are available. In addition, how-to guides and documentation templates simplify supporting PosOperators.
