# Services

After reading this, you can explain what kind of products fiskaltrust offers.



## Introduction

The service portfolio of *fiskaltrust* provides end-to-end solutions for your POS system to sign, persist, and manage its receipts in a **legally compliant** way. *fiskaltrust* offers a comprehensive and full-fledged stack of services around that topic and as a **unified approach across countries and markets**.

The services consist of a range of web-based tools, software bundles, interfaces, and [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) subscriptions. The following paragraphs will provide you with a brief overview on these topics.



## fiskaltrust.Middleware

*fiskaltrust.Middleware* is a **multi-platform**, **on-premise**ยน) software solution which complements your POS system and provides the core service of **signing POS receipts** using the relevant and required national signing mechanisms. It also **keeps track of receipts in a secure and auditable fashion** and makes sure your *fiskaltrust.Portal* account is up-to-date.

The Middleware is one of the centrepieces of the *fiskaltrust* stack and is available for all supported countries and provides a **single, standardised, and unified** communication interface, which greatly simplifies rollouts in new markets.

It features a **REST interface** for communication with your POS systems. The Middleware is available for all **.NET** supported platforms, as well as **Android**.

## fiskaltrust.Portal

*fiskaltrust.Portal* is your central management tool for the entire fiskaltrust stack. It is a web-based platform and allows you to e.g. manage your account, configure your *fiskaltrust.Middleware* instances, download deployment packages, and access and process your business data.



## Secure Receipt Archive

The archive service is an optional, paid add-on product, which enables your *fiskaltrust.Middleware* instances to use the archive facilities of fiskaltrust. When activated for an instance, the Middleware will regularly push new receipts into the archive, where they will be persisted in **secure** and **tamper-proof** receipt chain.

Archive data can be accessed and exported at any time (e.g. for a fiscal audit) via *fiskaltrust.Portal* and will be kept for **at least the period mandated by national regulations**.

### Exports & Third Party Interfaces

An active *archive service* package will allow you to export your data, using *fiskaltrust.Portal*, in a **variety of formats** relevant to the applicable national regulations.

In addition to manual exports, the portal also supports the integration of third party services. This makes it possible for you to associate your *fiskaltrust* account with your account at another service provider and have *fiskaltrust* transparently replicate your data over to your other account. The availability of this feature depends on the respective country and may require additional service subscriptions.



## Middleware-as-a-Service

In some countries, *fiskaltrust* offers a [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) version of the Middleware, allowing your POS system to sign and manage receipts with **no need of installing and maintaining additional software**. In this case, your POS system will connect to the *fiskaltrust*-hosted Middleware via an encrypted, **HTTPS-secured** Internet connection. These setups are managed exclusively via *fiskaltrust.Portal*.

:::note Service Availability

Service availability depends on national requirements and restrictions in each market.

## Hardware Leasing (SSCD-as-a-Service)

*fiskaltrust* offers a hardware leasing service in some of the countries where national regulations require the use of hardware dongles ([SSCDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_signature_creation_device)) for the issuance of receipt signatures. The service comes as a subscription model and provides you with the necessary hardware throughout the subscription period.
