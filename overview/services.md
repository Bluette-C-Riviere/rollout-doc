:::



## Introduction

*fiskaltrust* offers an end-to-end solution for your POS System to ensure it issues receipts in a legal and fiscally compliant way. The portfolio comprises a comprehensive stack of software and services around the topic of **fiscal compliance** and provides a **unified approach** across countries and markets.

The core components are the Middleware for **signing and tracking receipts** and the portal for **managing the service**. Additionally, there is a range of supporting services, interfaces to third party, and [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) subscriptions offered. The following paragraphs will provide you with a brief overview on these topics.



## Middleware

The Middleware is a **multi-platform** software solution which complements your POS System and provides the core service of **signing POS receipts** using the relevant and required national signing mechanisms. It also **keeps track of receipts in a secure and auditable fashion** and makes sure its relevant portal information is kept up-to-date.

The Middleware is one of the centrepieces of the *fiskaltrust* stack and is available for all supported countries and provides a **single, standardised, and unified** communication interface, which greatly simplifies rollouts in new markets.

It features a **REST interface** for communication with your POS Systems and is available for **on-premise** deployment on platforms supporting **.NET** and **Android**, as well as an **off-premise** SaaS solution. For the latter, please see [Hosted Middleware](#hosted-middleware) for further details.



## Portal

The portal is your central management tool for the entire *fiskaltrust* stack. It is a web-based platform and allows you to e.g. manage your account, configure your Middleware instances, download deployment packages, and access and process your business data.



## Revision-Safe Receipt Archive

The archive service is an optional, paid add-on product, which enables your Middleware instances to use the archive facilities of *fiskaltrust*. When activated for an instance, the Middleware will regularly push new receipts into the archive, where they will be persisted in **secure** and **tamper-proof** receipt chain.

Archive data can be accessed and exported at any time (e.g. for a fiscal audit) via the portal and will be kept for **at least the period mandated by national regulations**.

### Exports & Third Party Interfaces

An active *archive service* package will allow you to export your data, using the portal, in a **variety of formats** relevant to the applicable national regulations.

In addition to manual exports, the portal also supports the integration of third party services. This makes it possible for you to associate your *fiskaltrust* account with your account at another service provider and have *fiskaltrust* transparently replicate your data over to your other account. The availability of this feature depends on the respective country and may require additional service subscriptions.



## Hosted Middleware

In some countries, *fiskaltrust* offers a [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) version of the Middleware, allowing your POS System to sign and manage receipts with **no need of installing and maintaining additional software**. In this case, your POS System will connect to the *fiskaltrust*-hosted Middleware via an encrypted, **HTTPS-secured** Internet connection. These setups are managed exclusively via the portal.

## Signing

Where applicable, *fiskaltrust* offers dedicated **signing services** as backend for the Middleware, providing the required receipt signature data blocks according to the relevant national regulations. These are subscription-based services which, typically, come in the form of leased hardware dongles ([SSCDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_signature_creation_device)) or access to SaaS platforms.
