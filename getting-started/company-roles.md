Each role has a specific audience and comes with a distinct set of features and permissions.

1. **PosOperator**<br />
   This role is for **end-users of POS systems** who manage their POS receipts in the context of the services of *fiskaltrust*. They purchased the POS platform from their *PosDealer* and operate the POS system.

   *Accounts with this role use the portal primarily to access their fiscal data and perform maintenance steps not covered by their PosDealer.*

2. **PosDealer**<br />
   This role is for **POS system distributors** who sell POS systems to *PosOperators* and support and maintain these setups.

   *Accounts with this role use the portal primarily to act on behalf of their PosOperators. This includes invitation management, rollouts of CashBox setups and their maintenance.*

3. **PosCreator**<br />
   This role is for **POS system manufacturers** who develop the respective POS software. They are not primarily involved in rollouts or deployments but focus on the **technical integration** of the Middleware.

   *Accounts with this role use the portal primarily to set up their POS system definitions within the portal, create test configurations, and invite associated PosDealers.*

4. **Consultant**<br />
   This role is for **tax consultants** who advise *PosOperators* on related topics.

   *Accounts with this role use the portal primarily to access fiscal data of the associated (and authorised) operator accounts.*

:::caution

While you can select more than one role, please **only pick roles applicable to your business case** and no others, as each role entails different contractual requirements and obligations.
