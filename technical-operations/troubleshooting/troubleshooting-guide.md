# Troubleshooting Guide

After reading this, you can follow a structured way to determine the source of the problem.

## Explanation

Unfortunately, problems in the context of complex processes cannot always be avoided. Please use this 
Troubleshooting Guide on your way to solve or at least describe a problem.
This will help you avoid waiting times in case you need to contact support. The fiskaltrust.Staff will be happy to handle your requests if you are a PosDealer or a PosCreator. 
Since we do not know the respective constellations of POS-Systems on site and can therefore provide advice, we must always refer PosOperators to their PosDealer.

### Prerequisites

* PosDealers or PosCreators can contact fiskaltrust.Staff, no PosOperators
* The better the problem is described and searched, the faster the solution is found
* The country specific E-mail address to contact fiskaltrust.Staff you will find in the [Country-specific information](../information-sources/contacting-support).
