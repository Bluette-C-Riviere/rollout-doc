# Introduction

As a PosDealer, you want to get to know, understand and use the services and products of _fiskaltrust_. 

This documentation provides you an **Overview** of which _services_ are offered by _fiskaltrust_ in which _Countries_. The _Architecture_, _fiskaltrusts Management Portal_, the _Business model_ and _Legal/data protection_ issues are explained.

Before rolling out a POS system at a customer site, you need a playground to test the services and products in detail. At **Get Started** we explain the concept of our _Sandbox_. _Registration_ and use is free of charge. After that you will get familiar with _Company Roles_ and the _Operator Onboarding_ and then follow _My First Cashbox_ to create your first demo setup.

With **Buy/Resell** you can expand your knowledge of our business model. You will learn how to make a _Framework Agreement_ for which _Products_. With _Rollout Management_, rollouts at the PosOperator succeed in a standardized manner, and with the _Shop_ in a highly individualized manner.  

In the **Technical Operations** section you will find _Scenarios_ for using our products for different requirements. In-depth details on _Middleware_ and _Rollout Automation_ avoid time-consuming problems with _Troubleshooting_ or _Maintenance_.

_fiskaltrust_ provides you as PosDealer with **Information sources**. On the one hand, you will find the _Knowledge Base_ in the fiskaltrust.Portal,
possible _Cases_ at our support as well as contractual information and various exports for download. Use our tips for the efficient use of this _Documentation_, read our _News_ and learn more about further information sources such as _Webinars_ and _Videos_. If _Contacting support_ should be necessary, we will help you prepare your request to best support the process.

Please use the **Recommended reading** section below to learn our recommendations depending on your role in handling our products and services.
**Where to start** will provide you with recommendations on which content to work on depending on your focus.
