For this setup we choose a rollout plan based on TBD. This plan will create a new queue, a new CashBox, and link the previously created SCU to it.

To start the Technical rollout **log into your portal account** and proceed with the following steps.

1. Open your the **rollout management page** from [`Rollout Management` / `Plan`](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.de/RolloutManagement/Plan) (*Sandbox link*) in the left-hand navigation menu.
2. Select `Technical Rollout - Creating cashboxes at scale`.
3. **Filter** for TBD.
4. Select the plan TBD.
5. Select `Perform the rollout for the current account`.
6. Tick the **same outlet** you chose before during the Business rollout.
7. Click `Submit Selection`.
8. Click `Create quote` - *this will take a few seconds. Once the quote is ready, the button will change to `Load quote into cart`.*
9. Click `Load quote into cart` to **place the quote** into your shopping cart.
10. Verify that the items in your shopping cart match the selected products.
11. Click `Checkout`.
12. Click `binding order` to **complete the order**.

-----

At this point should have the order listed under [`Shop` / `Orders`](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.de/Shop/Orders). Finishing the order can take a couple of minutes, but once it has been completed you should have

* a **new queue** under [`Configuration` / `Queue`](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.de/Queue)
* a **new CashBox** under [`Configuration` / `CashBox`](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.de/CashBox)
