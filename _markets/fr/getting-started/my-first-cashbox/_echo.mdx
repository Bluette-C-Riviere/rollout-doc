This example uses REST as communication protocol and requires your CashBox to have a REST helper enabled.

:::

To perform an "echo" request, you will need to send a `POST` request to the configured Middleware URL, with the path `/json/Echo`. That request takes a JSON string in its request body, containing the message string you'd like to receive back from the Middleware.

For example, to send `Hello fiskaltrust.Middleware!` as request string, we'd be sending the following request body along with the `POST` request

```json
"Hello fiskaltrust.Middleware!"
```

The following HTTP request example would send above's string to the Middleware.

```http
POST /json/Echo HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Length: 31
Content-Type: application/json

"Hello fiskaltrust.Middleware!"
```

The response to your request should have a status code of 200 and contain the same string, you sent in the request, in the response body.
