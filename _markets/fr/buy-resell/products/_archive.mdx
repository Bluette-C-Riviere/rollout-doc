### ArchiveAuditable
The _ArchiveAuditable_ is a **cloud service** which provides a searchable, secure, and **audit-proof** database for Middleware receipts. Activating it for a CashBox will also enable its Middleware instance to regularly push its new receipts into the archive, where they'll be securely persisted in a revision-safe storage. The data is kept for **at least six years**, following French regulations.

#### Exports
Stored receipt data can be accessed and exported at any time via the Portal (e.g., for a fiscal audit).
