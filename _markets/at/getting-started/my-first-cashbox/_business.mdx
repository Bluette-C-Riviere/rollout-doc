For this setup, we choose a fiskaltrust.Carefree plan. The fiskaltrust.Carefree plan will create a Carefree bundle including an OnlineSignature SCU. For a quick tutorial, we refrain from choosing a PosOperator and its outlets but assign the bundle to your account and outlet. 

To start the Business rollout, **log into your portal account** and proceed with the following steps.

import ReactPlayer from "react-player"

<ReactPlayer controls url={require("./media/business-rollout.mp4").default} /><br />

1. Open your the **rollout management page** from [`Rollout Management` / `Plan`](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.at/RolloutManagement/Plan) (*Sandbox link*) in the left-hand navigation menu.
2. Select `Business Rollout - Rolling out products`.
3. **Filter** for `Carefree` and **limit entries** to `Dealerpackage based plans`.
4. Select the plan **4154-0001**. This plan will create **a Carefree bundle**.
5. Select `Perform the rollout for the current account`.
6. Tick the **desired outlet** where you would like to roll out the Middleware.
7. Click `Submit Selection`.
8. Click `Create quote` - *this will take a few seconds. Once the quote is ready, the button will change to `Load quote into cart`.*
9. Click `Load quote into cart` to **place the quote** into your shopping cart.
10. Verify that the items in your shopping cart match the selected products.
11. Click `Checkout`.
12. Click `binding order` to **complete the order**.

-----

At this point, should have the order listed under [`Shop` / `Orders`](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.at/Shop/Orders). Finishing the order can take a couple of minutes, but once it has been completed, there should be the following items active in your account

* two **new demo subscriptions** under [`Shop` / `Subscriptions`](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.at/Shop/Subscriptions)
* the 'Carefree' column for the selected outlet under [`Company Name` / `Outlets`](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.at/AccountOutlet) shows a symbol for an active Carefree subscription.
