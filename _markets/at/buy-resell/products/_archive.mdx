### fiskaltrust.POS-Archiv
The _fiskaltrust.POS-Archiv_ is a **cloud service** which provides a searchable, secure, and **audit-proof** database for Middleware receipts. Activating it for a CashBox will also enable its Middleware instance to regularly push its new receipts into the archive, where they'll be securely persisted in a revision-safe storage. In accordance with Austrian regulations, data is kept for **at least seven years**.

#### DEP exports
Stored receipt data can be accessed and exported at any time via the Portal (e.g. for a fiscal audit) both in the **formats required by the tax regulations** (DEP or _"Datenerfassungsprotokoll"_) and in a **full data export format**, containing all sent requests and responses.
