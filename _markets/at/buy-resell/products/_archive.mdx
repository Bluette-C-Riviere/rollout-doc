### fiskaltrust.POS-Archiv

fiskaltrust.POS-Archiv is a **portal service** which provides a searchable, secure, and **audit-proof** database for your Middleware receipts. Activating it for a CashBox will also enable its Middleware instance to regularly push its new receipts into the archive, where they'll be securely persisted in a tamper-proof receipt chain.

Stored receipt data can be accessed and exported at any time via the portal (e.g. for a fiscal audit) and is kept for at least seven years, according to Austrian regulations.
