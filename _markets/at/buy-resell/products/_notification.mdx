To perform the necessary notification to FinanzOnline and receipt audit, you must purchase a product that includes these services. The taxpayer is responsible for these notifications being performed and must check successful completion before the expiration of the deadline.
Fiskaltrust assumes no liability if a notification has not been performed. However, as a PosDealer, you can only achieve the necessary processes if all prerequisites are met (e.g., correct FinanzOnline Access Tokens in the fiskaltrust.Portal).
It is included in the fiskaltrust.Carefree Bundle.
