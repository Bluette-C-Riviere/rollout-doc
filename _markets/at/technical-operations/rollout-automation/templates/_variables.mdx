| `reference_scu_{type}_{key}_{value}_{attr}` | References the indicated attribute (`attr`) of an existing SCU with the given key/value pair (`key`/`value`) and the specified type (`type`). |
| `reference_scu_{type}_{attr}` | References the indicated attribute (`attr`) of the first existing SCU and the specified type (`type`). |

### Reference variables

Reference variables allow you to reference values from other components. Their overall name structure is

```
reference_scu_{type}_{key}_{value}_{attr}

reference_scu_{type}_{attr}
```

Where the four dynamic parts (denoted by curly brackets) specify which attribute of which component you exactly want to reference. The first existing SCU is selected in the second reference where the reference doesn't contain a key/value.



#### Type

Indicates the SCU type you want to reference. Possible values for `type` are

* `onlinescu`

#### Key / Value

Provides a key-value pair that you can use to filter for the SCU of the indicated SCU type. The scope is always your **account** and the **outlet** where you create the CashBox. You cannot reference SCUs from other outlets or accounts.



#### Attribute

The actual attribute you'd like to refer to. Currently, `id` and `url` are supported.



#### Example

::: info Default field with shop-bought SCUs

Any SCU bought via fiskaltrust.Shop or Rollout Management can have an incrementing integer field `counter` assigned.

:::

Let's say you have purchased two onlinescu SCUs for one outlet via fiskaltrust.Shop. In that case, their SCUs can have a `counter` field with  values of `1` and '2'. Using a reference variable in your template, you can now reference these SCUs (in particular their IDs, in this example) by using the following variable.


```
|[reference_scu_onlinescu_counter_1_id]|
|[reference_scu_onlinescu_counter_2_id]|
```

or if you have only one onlinescu in your outlet, the key/value can be ignored by using the following variable.

```
|[reference_scu_onlinescu_id]|
```

In a different example, let's assume you assign a field `masterPOS` manually to your SCU and want to reference the URL of the SCU where `masterPOS` is set to `true`. In that case, you'd use the following variable.

```
|[reference_scu_onlinescu_masterPOS_true_url]|
```
