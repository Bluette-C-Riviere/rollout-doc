### POS Archiv

The archive service enables your Middleware instance to use the archive facilities of *fiskaltrust*. When activated for an instance, the Middleware will regularly push new  receipts into the archive, where they will be persisted in **secure** and **tamper-proof** receipt chain.

Archive data can be accessed and exported at any time (e.g. for a fiscal audit) via the portal and will be kept for **at least the period mandated by national regulations**.
