### POS Archiv

The POS Archive is a **cloud service** which provides a searchable, secure, and **audit-proof** database for Middleware receipts. Activating it for a CashBox will also enable its Middleware instance to regularly push its new receipts into the archive, where they'll be securely persisted in a revision-safe storage. In accordance with Austrian regulations, data is kept for **at least ten years**.

#### Receipt exports (DSFinV-K and DFKA)
Stored receipt data can be accessed and exported at any time via the Portal (e.g. for a fiscal audit) in the **format required by the tax regulations (_DSFinV-K_)**, the commonly used **DFKA taxonomy format** and in a **full data export format**, containing all sent requests and responses.

#### TAR file export
The log data from the uses Technical Security System (TSS) is frequently exported and uploaded to the POS Archiv, where it can be downloaded as well.
