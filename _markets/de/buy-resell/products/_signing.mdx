This documentation uses the English term _Technical Security System_ when speaking about signing devices in Germany instead of the German abbreviation _TSE_ (_Technische Sicherheitseinrichtung_). The two terms can be used interchangeably.

### Supported Technical Security Systems
The fiskaltrust.Middleware support all certified TSSs that are currently available on the market:

**Hardware**:
- Swissbit USB

While not all of these TSSs are available in our Shop, we provide a sufficient mixture of the most used cloud and hardware variants (as described below). Individually bought TSSs of the vendors listed above are compatible with the Middleware.

### TSE-as-a-Service
_TSE-as-a-Service_ is a yearly, subscription-based leasing model for **hardware and cloud TSSs**. Purchasing a *TSE-as-a-Service* package will provide you **for the duration of the subscription** with either the necessary hardware or the applicable access credentials for the respective online service. When the subscription expires hardware needs to be returned, or the subscription has to be renewed.

_TSE-as-a-Service_ cannot be purchased as individual product, but only as part of a *[fiskaltrust.Sorglos](product-bundles)* bundle.
