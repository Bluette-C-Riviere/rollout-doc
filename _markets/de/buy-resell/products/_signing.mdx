This documentation uses the English term _Technical Security System_ when speaking about signing devices in Germany instead of the German abbreviation _TSE_ (_Technische Sicherheitseinrichtung_). However, you can use the two terms interchangeably.

### Supported Technical Security Systems
The fiskaltrust.Middleware support all certified TSSs that are currently available on the market:

**Hardware**:
- Swissbit USB
- CryptoVision/Bundesdruckerei
- Epson
- Diebold Nixdorf

**Cloud**:
- Swissbit Cloud

While not all TSSs are available in our shop, we provide a good mixture of the most used cloud and hardware variants (as described below). In addition, individually bought TSSs of the vendors listed above are compatible with the Middleware.

### TSE-as-a-Service
_TSE-as-a-Service_ is a yearly, subscription-based leasing model for **hardware and cloud TSSs**. Purchasing a *TSE-as-a-Service* package will provide you **for the duration of the subscription** with the necessary hardware or the applicable access credentials for the respective online service. When the subscription expires, you or your PosOperator need to return the hardware or renew the subscription.

You cannot purchase a _TSE-as-a-Service_ as an individual product, but only as part of a *[fiskaltrust.Sorglos](product-bundles)* bundle.

### Individual TSE products
In addition to the [TSE subscription service](#tse-as-a-service), fiskaltrust also offers several different TSE devices and products for individual purchase in its shop.
