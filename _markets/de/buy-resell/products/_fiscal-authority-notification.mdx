# Fiscal Authority Notification (in Developement)

:::caution 

This feature is currently not available, as the authorities have not published a final process yet. To our current knowledge, the post-registration of POS Systems already in use will be necessary, once it is published.
Our Systems already track activation and deactivation of queues. This means we are perfectly prepared to perform these notifications, as soon as the lawmaker defines the process.
:::

Notification to the responsible tax office for activation and deactivation of digital recording systems, as soon as demanded by tax authorities. 

## Availability

A few weeks after appropriate interfaces for automated notifications to the responsible tax office are available.
