## Fair Use Policy

**fiskaltrust Deutschland GmbH**

## Scope
This Fair Use Policy applies to the use of site-related products of **fiskaltrust**.

## Definition of terms

This section defines and explains the terms used in this Fair Use Policy.

### Outlet

An outlet generally represents a physical location (branch or subsidiary) of the PosOperator (Operator of a POS-System).  
However, a physical location can also be represented by several virtual outlets if the fair use rules described here cannot be observed with the help of a single outlet. 

### Active queue

An active queue is a queue in use that has been commissioned by a Initial operation receipt and has not yet been decommissioned by a Out of operation receipt / stop-receipt.  
It represents an electronic recording system with cash register function. 

### Terminals

Terminals are input devices connected to an electronic recording system with a cash register function that do not implement an independent cash register function.  
Within the _fiskaltrust_ IPOS Interface, these are identified by means of the field `cbTerminalID`. 

### Outlet-related products of fiskaltrust

Outlet-related products are products (or subscriptions) that are purchased per outlet.  
They are used for the outlet's subordinate recording systems (queues) and technical security equipment (TSE / SCU) (e.g., carefree bundles).

## Fair Use Rules 

If location-based products from **fiskaltrust** are used in an outlet, a maximum of 25 active queues with a total of a maximum of 25 cash registers or terminals may be operated in the affected outlet.  
In addition, a maximum of 150,000 TSE signatures per calendar month may be requested in the affected outlet.  
These fair use rules may be adjusted by **fiskaltrust** due to specific characteristics of individual site-related products. Therefore, please also pay attention to the specific product characteristics.

### Recommendation for compliance with the fair use rule

If a physical location cannot be covered by a single outlet due to higher requirements, you have the option to create additional virtual outlets for this physical location in thefiskaltrust.Portal. The virtual outlets must be created with the address of the physical location in thefiskaltrust.Portal so that they can be assigned to it.  
The required location-specific _fiskaltrust_ products can then be purchased separately for each outlet created.

### Non-compliance with the Fair Use Policy

In the event of non-compliance with the Fair Use Policy, **fiskaltrust** reserves the right to restrict the operation of the products and components used in the affected outlet until they are again within the fair use framework described herein.

### Estimation of the TSE signature count

The number of signatures depends on the implementation and use of the particular POS System and TSE, but it can be estimated based on the number of transactions. Each sign operation on the fiskaltrust.middleware generates transactions and signatures, however administrative operations of the TSE itself also result in signatures. Cloud TSEs can expect an average of 2-3 signatures per transaction, hardware TSEs 3-8.
