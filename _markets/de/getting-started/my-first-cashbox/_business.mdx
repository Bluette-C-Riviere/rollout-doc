For this setup we choose a fiskaltrust.Carefree plan with a fiskaly TSE. This will create a Carefree and TSE-as-a-Service bundle and automatically create and assign a fiskaly TSE to your account. Being an online TSE, there are no further hardware provisioning steps required from your side.

To start the Business rollout, **log into your portal account** and proceed with the following steps.
