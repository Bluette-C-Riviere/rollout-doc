For this setup we choose a *fiskaltrust.Carefree* plan with a *fiskaly TSE*. This will create a Carefree and TSE-as-a-Service bundle and automatically create and assign a *fiskaly TSE* to your account. Being an online TSE, there are no further hardware provisioning steps required from your side.

To start the Technical rollout **log into your portal account** and proceed with the following steps.

1. Open your the **rollout management page** from [`Rollout Management` / `Plan`](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.de/RolloutManagement/Plan) (*Sandbox link*) in the left-hand navigation menu.

5. Select `Perform the rollout for the current account`.
6. Tick the **same outlet** you chose before during the Business rollout.
7. Click `Submit Selection`.

9. Click `Load quote into cart` to **place the quote** into your shopping cart.
