| `reference_scu_{type}_{key}_{value}_{attr}` | References the indicated attribute (`attr`) of an existing SCU with the given key/value pair (`key`/`value`) and the specified type (`type`). |

### Reference variables

Reference variables allow you to reference values from other components. Their overall name structure is

```
reference_scu_{type}_{key}_{value}_{attr}
```

Where the four dynamic parts (denoted by curly brackets) specify which attribute of which component you exactly want to reference.



#### Type

Indicates the SCU type you want to reference. Possible values for `type` are

* `cryptovision`
* `dieboldnixdorf`
* `epson`
* `fiskalycertified`
* `swissbit`
* `swissbitcloud`



#### Key / Value

Provides a key-value pair that you can use to filter for the SCU of the indicated SCU type. The scope is always your **account** and the **outlet** where you create the CashBox. You cannot reference SCUs from other outlets or accounts.



#### Attribute

The actual attribute you'd like to reference. Currently, `id` and `url` are supported.



#### Example

:::info Default field with shop-bought SCUs

Any TSE bought via fiskaltrust.Shop will automatically have an incrementing integer field `counter` assigned.

:::

Let's say you have purchased fiskaly TSEs for all your outlets via fiskaltrust.Shop. In that case, their SCUs should all have a `counter` field with the value of `1`. Using a reference variable in your template, you can now reference these SCUs (in particular their IDs, in this example) by using the following variable.


```
|[reference_scu_fiskalycertified_counter_1_id]|
```

In a different example, let's assume you assign a field `masterPOS` manually to all your SCUs and want to reference the URL of the SCU where `masterPOS` is set to `true`. In that case, you'd use the following variable.

```
|[reference_scu_fiskalycertified_masterPOS_true_url]|
```
